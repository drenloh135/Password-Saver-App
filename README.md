# Password-Saver-App
Pardon me for the unoriginal application name.

For awhile now, I've always been struggling with remembering usernames and passwords for the countless accounts I've have created on various platforms. While there are a ton of password saving applications out there, I decided to create a simple one for my own purposes. It was also a chance for me to explore using tkinter and pyinstaller. 

While I have released an executable file, and consider this "Finished", I will come back time to time to update and improve on it. Currently, the app only has the following functionalities:
- Show passwords
- Add passwords
- Clear passwords

Below are a list of ideas that I plan to implement on this application in the near future.

1. Automatically send file to email
2. Password to unlock app and file
3. Encryption (DONE 4/4/20)
4. Implement a GUI
